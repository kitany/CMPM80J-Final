UNIT 1: WAR
third person view, opposite to war gamees or FPS shooters about war (think COD, excape from tarkov, etc)
grief, loss, and punishment
while silent hill’s gameplay is by far the furthest away from what war games are defined as. most share similar themes of grief, loss, and punishment
MUSIC pushes these agendas, feelings of regret, sadness, and somberness
network: reddit threads, game discussion boards, connect the players together socially despite it being a single-player game

UNIT 2: FLOW/IMMERSION
music transports player to new area, immerses their emotions
deserted town, muffled music and foggy environment – as if the fog is muffling the music for you
uncovering the mystery of the town in Maine
it doesn’t need to break the fourth wall to be good
system’s immersion, cutscenes with animations that feel TOO REAL but also uncanny. scene with laura in jail, sobbing audios
intense emotions 

UNIT 3: NARRATIVE/AGENCY
alternative implementation of agency – invisible agency
emphasis on exploration of the evironment, but also protagonist’s character
six possible endings (2 are jokes THINK: easter eggs for playerbase!)
player who has never read a walkthrough does not know the requirements for each ending (THINK: doesn’t know the weight of each choice on the ending reached)
the player’s obscure actions and overall attitude of the game (the player does not know when they are actually making decisions)
psyche of the player is the real agency given to them – NO BINARY CHOICES
invisible agency opposed “A Bestiary of Player Agency” which explains most big decisions are binary and visually show importance
ORDINARY VANITY song creates serious tone, the player is put into a mood where they must create decisions they don’t even know are important
“Music also lights up nearly all of the brain — including the hippocampus and amygdala, which activate emotional responses to music through memory; the limbic system, which governs pleasure, motivation, and reward; and the body’s motor system” Harvard Study
players are encouraged to do certain actions with mood of music
music follows main theme of mystery and suspense
